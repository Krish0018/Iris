# Iris

### About the project
This project is based on K Nearest Neighbour model.
The data is not uploaded seperately because I've used it directly from pandas.
In this project I've tried to classify the species according to its nearest known species.


### Tool Used
Used Python for data analysis for that particular dataset. Libraries used for this project are:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

### Installation
for numpy
```pip install numpy```


for Pandas
```pip install pandas```


For Matplotlib
```pip install matplotlib```


For Seaborn
```pip install seaborn```




### Key Insights

So This is how an Iris dataset looks like.

To compare all the species with each other in terms of visualization used the following code and it's output is
```sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species')```

### Remark
For this particular project, I've used the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm for classification and got a descent accuracy.
